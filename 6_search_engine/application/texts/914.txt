Beehive Casemate is a historical fortification located on the banks of Obelisk Bay , in Sydney Harbour , New South Wales , Australia . Construction began in 1871 and was completed in 1874 . The fort was constructed under the supervision of colonial architect James Barnet . The underground Casemate was one of the first to be locally designed and built after the withdrawal of British troops in 1870 and the Cardwell Reforms . The fortification contains three domed chambers that were used as gun emplacements , each chamber had a small opening or window for the gun to fire through with each window looking out towards the Sydney Heads . The underground chambers were made of brick and mortar and were built into the excavated cavities in the sandstone bedrock . They were intended to fire on enemy ships as they navigated the passages around Sow and Pigs Reef , within the entrance to Sydney Harbour .
