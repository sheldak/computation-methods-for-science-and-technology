The National Union of Public Employees ( NUPE ) was a British trade union which existed between 1908 and 1993 . It represented public sector workers . # History # The union was founded in 1908 as the National Union of Corporation Workers , which split from the Municipal Employees Association , following Albin Taylor 's dismissal as General Secretary . The union became NUPE in 1925 . The NUPE grew rapidly , from a membership of 250,100 in 1966 to 693,100 members in 1977 , making it the fifth largest union in Britain . In 1993 , NUPE merged with NALGO ( the National and Local Government Officers Association ) and COHSE ( the Confederation of Health Service Employees ) to form UNISON . A similarly named trade union exists in New Zealand as of 2012. # General Secretaries # *1908 : Albin Taylor * *1934 : Bryn Roberts *1962 : Sydney Hill *1968 : Alan Fisher *1982 : Rodney Bickerstaffe
