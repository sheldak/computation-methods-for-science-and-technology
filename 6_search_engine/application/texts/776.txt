: ' ' For other persons with the cognomen Albus or Albinus , see Albinus ( cognomen ) . ' ' Aulus Postumius Albinus Magnus was a general of ancient Rome , of patrician rank , of the 2nd century BC , who was brother of Spurius Postumius Albinus , and probably son of Spurius Postumius Albinus Magnus . He was left by his brother as propraetor in command of the army in Africa in 110 BC . He marched to besiege Suthal , where the treasures of Jugurtha were held ; but Jugurtha , under the promise of giving him a large sum of money , induced him to lead his army into a retired place , where he was suddenly attacked by the Numidian king , and only saved his troops from total destruction by allowing them to pass under the yoke ( a symbolic gesture of submission to the enemy ) , and undertaking to leave Numidia in ten days .
