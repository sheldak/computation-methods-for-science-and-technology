Putiidhem was a large native village of the Acjachemen people , today the Mission Indians tribe goes by the name ' ' Juaneo ' ' . It is situated in San Juan Capistrano , California just off Interstate 5 , about a mile north of the mission . # History # The site of the village , used from approximately 1200 CE until 1776 when the Acjachemen were moved to Mission San Juan Capistrano , is variously described as an ancient/pre-historic village and as a gravesite . The site , when an open field , was used until recently as a sacred site by the Juaneos . For many years , rodeos and circuses were held at that location . # Present day # The property is currently occupied by the gymnasium , athletic fields and performing arts complex of Junpero Serra High School . The construction of this complex was unsuccessfully blocked by the Juaneo , who protested after human remains were discovered at the site , thus giving it cultural value .
