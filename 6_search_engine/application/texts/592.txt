In enzymology , a 3-hydroxycyclohexanone dehydrogenase ( ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction : 3-hydroxycyclohexanone + acceptor <math> rightleftharpoons </math> cyclohexane-1,3-dione + reduced acceptor Thus , the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-hydroxycyclohexanone and acceptor , whereas its two products are cyclohexane-1,3-dione and reduced acceptor . This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors . The systematic name of this enzyme class is **31;73867;TOOLONG 1-oxidoreductase .
