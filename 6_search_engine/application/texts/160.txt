According to Hindu Religion , it is the name of the Goddess Lakshmi . Sri or Bhargavi is the daughter of sage Bhrigu and his wife Khyati . Sri is an incarnation of the Goddess AdiShakti . Bhrigu was a sage in Prajapati Daksha 's court , and a devotee of Shiva . Lord Vishnu ( Narayana ) had married Lakshmi , Bhrigu 's daughter . Because She was the daughter of Bhrigu , she got the name Bhargavi . Bhargavi is mentioned as one of the names of Lakshmi in the Lakshmi Ashtakam . Lakshmi had to leave Vaikunta and live in Kshirsagar ( different reasons are given in different scriptures ) , until Samudra Manthan . After Samudra Manthan , She emerged from Kshirsagar and reached Lord Vishnu 's abode Vaikunta , and lived with him as his eternal consort .
