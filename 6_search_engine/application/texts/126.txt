Group One or Group 1 is the term used for the highest level of Thoroughbred and Standardbred stakes races in many countries . Group One ( G1 ) races may be run under handicap conditions in Australia , but in Europe weight-for-age conditions always apply . Races may be also restricted to age groups or a stipulated sex . In the United States , Canada , Japan , South Africa , and British National Hunt racing Grade I is used instead . These races , whether designated as Group One or Grade I , attract the best horses , and are for very large stake money .
