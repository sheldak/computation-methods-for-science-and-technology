' ' Pleioblastus ' ' is a genus of monopodial bamboos , native to China and Japan . Genetic research indicates that this genus may properly be part of the genus ' ' Arundinaria ' ' . The plant spreads by vigorous underground rhizomes which run along just beneath the soil surface , producing plantlets at the nodes . These can be used to propagate new plants , but if not removed they can become invasive . The species ' ' P. variegatus ' ' ( green and cream stripes ) , and ' ' P. viridistriatus ' ' ( green and yellow stripes ) have gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden Merit .
