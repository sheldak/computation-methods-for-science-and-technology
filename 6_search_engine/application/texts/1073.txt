It can be found in ' ' Scutellaria barbata ' ' and ' ' S. lateriflora ' ' . The determination of the structure of scutellarin took Guido Goldschmiedt many years : after the first publication on that topic in 1901 , only in 1910 he managed to obtain enough starting material for more detailed studies . Scutellarin has been shown to induce apoptosis of ovarian and breast tumor cells ' ' in vitro ' ' . # References #
