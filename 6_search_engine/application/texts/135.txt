The Yankie Bar is a popular chocolate bar in Denmark . This caramel , nougat , and milk chocolate bar is a product of the Toms candy company . # History # Just after the Second World War , the Danish candy producer , Toms , were contacted by the United States high command in Germany , which commissioned Toms to produce a candy bar for the American troops in Germany to avoid transporting such products across the Atlantic . In return , the U.S. would supply Toms with the required amount of cocoa beans . The Yankie Bar is very similar to the European version of the Mars Bar , and both the American troops and the Danish youth found it very tasty . Ten years later , in 1956 , Toms launched the Holly bar , similar to the Yankie bar , but with hazelnuts .
