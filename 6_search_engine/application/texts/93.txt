In 1871 a design and model for a new state crown was created to reflect the new German Empire . The model was based upon the Crown of the Holy Roman Empire and was kept in the Hohenzollern museum at Schloss Monbijou in Berlin , until it disappeared during World War II . It has never re-surfaced . No final Crown was ever made . However , the design was used as a heraldic device for the German Kaisers from 1871 until Kaiser Wilhelm 's abdication in 1918 . The crown was most used as an heraldic symbol , in the German coat of arms and the Emperor 's personal standard . A drawing of the crown is used as an emblem by a German monarchist group called Tradition und Leben ( tradition and life ) . Crowns for the Empress and Crown Prince were also designed and wooden models made ; see Imperial Crowns - Prussian-German Imperial Crowns .
