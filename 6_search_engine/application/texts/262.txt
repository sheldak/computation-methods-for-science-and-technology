Roggenwolf is an Australian-based developer of military camouflage patterns . The design group was founded by Brad Turner , a former member of the Australian Defence Force . According to Brad Turner their camouflage patterns are superior to the MARPAT , ACUPAT , CADPAT and Flecktarn patterns , though this remains unproven . Roggenwolf patterns are designed to use a mixture of micropatterns and macropatterns to create contrasting patterns .
