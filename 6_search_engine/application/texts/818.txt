Pockmarks are craters in the seabed caused by fluids ( gas and liquids ) erupting and streaming through the sediments . Pockmarks were discovered off the coasts of Nova Scotia , Canada in the late 1960s by Lew King and Brian McLean of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography . As pockmarks are uncommon on the land surface , they are expected in the ocean . They were discovered off Nova Scotia , using a new side scan sonar developed in the late 1960s by Kelvin Hughes . **6;721;br The craters off Nova Scotia are up to 150 m in diameter and 10 m deep . Pockmarks have been found worldwide . Discovery was aided by the use of high-resolution multibeam acoustic systems for bathymetric mapping . In these cases , pockmarks have been interpreted as the morphological expression of gas or oil leakage from active hydrocarbon system or a deep overpressured petroleum reservoir .
