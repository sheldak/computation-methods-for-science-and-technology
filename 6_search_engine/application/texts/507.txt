The caisa is a musical instrument made of steel and wood . The steel section resembles the top of a steelpan and the wooden base section resembles a horn-like stand . The steel and wood are held together with a stretchy rope material ; there is no direct contact between the steel and the wood . Sound is emitted from the gap between the steel and the wood and not from the horn at the base . The tone areas are hammered by hand and are usually in a pentatonic scale comprising ten to twelve notes . The central note is much deeper . The latest version of the caisa consists solely of metal . The instrument can be played either on the lap with the horn held between the legs or can be stood on its wooden base . The caisa is played with the hands in manner similar to that of the Hang , but it sounds more like a meditation pan . From the side , the instrument resembles a mushroom . The caisa is made in Germany by Bill Brown .
