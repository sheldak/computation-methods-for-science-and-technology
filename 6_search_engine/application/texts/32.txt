' ' Dissertation on the English Language ' ' was a book written by American lexicographer Noah Webster in 1789 . The book followed Webster 's 1783 work ' ' Spelling Book ' ' and aimed to differentiate American English from British English . In the book , Webster commented that our honor requires us to have a system of our own , in language as well as government . Great Britain .. should no longer be ' ' our ' ' standard ; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted , and her language on the decline . This dissertation was dedicated to Benjamin Franklin . # Footnotes # # References # *
