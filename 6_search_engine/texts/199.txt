The West Branch flows through the neighborhood of Penn Wynne and the East Branch flows through the Green Hill Condominiums . After flowing across City Line Avenue ( U.S. Route 1 ) into Philadelphia , they enter Morris Park . Near Haverford Avenue both streams are piped underground , joining up beneath a recreational area within Morris park . The combined Indian Creek re-emerges on the south side of Haverford Avenue near 69th Street , and flows through more parkland and then the Cobbs Creek Golf Course , until it joins Cobbs Creek near the 69th Street Terminal , on the Upper Darby side of the banks of Cobbs Creek . The creek was once the site of a number of factories and mills .
