3109514 EMC Invista is a software product , first introduced in 2005 , which provides a storage virtualization solution that runs on intelligent storage area network switches ( i.e. selected models of Cisco or Brocade switches ) . Main feature of Invista is dynamic seamless data migration between two storage devices . Additionally it features dynamic volume management , cloning and snapshots . Invista relies on Split-Path Architecture ( SPA ) to manage data flows . The intelligent switch redirects all control commands ( e.g. SCSI Inquiry , Read Capacity , or Report LUNs ) to a pair of redundant external controllers called Control Path Cluster ( CPC ) , while the stream of I/O transactions flows directly from the host to the appropriate physical storage array via the intelligent switch hardware . In some release , CPC and the switch communicate using SNMP over an Ethernet connection . Invista can be configured in a redundant and highly available fashion so it contains no single point of failure . Invista 's management tool is a Java-based GUI called Invista Element Manager ( a CLI is also available ) .
