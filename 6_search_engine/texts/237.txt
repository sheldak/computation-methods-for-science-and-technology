6756514 The Galapagos Microplate is a small tectonic plate off the west coast of South America near the Galapagos Islands . It differs from most other crustal plates in that it is rotating clockwise between three much larger crustal plates around it , the Nazca , Cocos and Pacific Plates . To its north , an even smaller microplate , the Northern Galapagos Microplate is likewise rotating , but counterclockwise . Both microplates mesh along the interface between them .
