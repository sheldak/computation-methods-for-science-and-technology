17841514 Some more recent research has other findings , but according to early twentieth century writers in 1932 , an interregnum queen , is a Great Royal Wife of a previous pharaoh who rules as a regent in the place of her heir-son , who has not yet reached the age to solely assume the role of pharaoh of Egypt . Officially the young heir-son is assumed to be king , ' ' de iure ' ' , making , in theory , his mother a co-regent . In practice , the interregnum queen rules ' ' in the place ' ' of the young male heir as sole ruler , until the heir-son reaches an age when he could assume the duties of pharaoh alone . The term Interregnum Queen may have been the equivalent of the term King 's Mother . # Notes #
