37617514 ' ' Feeling Sexy ' ' is a 1999 Australian short feature from artist Davida Allen . Allen later described the film as : # A lovely plum pudding story . It 's not out there with a big sign saying that this is the answer . But like all stories you can just get a little taste of ' we could do that ' . There 's hope and , as a Catholic , I feel that there is hope and I want to tell stories that say there is hope . It 's a love story unlike the Hollywood stories which say move on ; it 's not working here so move on . ' ' Feeling Sexy ' ' is not a kind of Bible story that says , ' Drat it , this is going to be hard work ' . It 's just a different angle at looking at a universal situation . It 's a celebration of monogamy . It 's very similar to a seed which , unless it 's watered , dies . #
