10001514 geology = Limestone Sidcot Swallet is a cave near Burrington Combe , in the Carboniferous Limestone of the Mendip Hills , in Somerset , England . It was named after the Sidcot School Speleological Society who explored it in 1925 . A swallet , also known as a sinkhole , sink , shakehole , swallow hole or doline , is a natural depression or hole in the surface topography caused by the removal of soil or bedrock , often both , by water flowing beneath . After Goatchurch Cavern , Sidcot Swallet is probably the most popular cave on Mendip for novice parties . What it lacks in length or depth is adequately compensated for by its sporty squeezes and narrow crawls . Despite its popularity , many calcite formations still remain intact in the farthest reaches of the cave . # See also # * Caves of the Mendip Hills # References #
