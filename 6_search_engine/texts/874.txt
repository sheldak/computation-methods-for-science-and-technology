31960514 The ' ' Madonna of the Quail ' ' ( Italian : ' ' Madonna della Quaglia ' ' ) is an International Gothic painting generally attributed to Pisanello . Dating to c. 1420 , it is currently housed in the Castelvecchio Museum of Verona , northern Italy . # Description # The painting depicts the Madonna with Child crowned by two flying angels , sitting inside a rose garden in typical late Gothic style . The painter put a great attention in the representation of vegetables and birds , including the quail in the foreground , which gives its name to the painting . The heavenly appearance of the scene is enhanced by the gilt background . The rendering of the Madonna and her clothes resemble those of the works by Gentile da Fabriano , whose workshop Pisanello was a member of at the time . The setting is also similar to the contemporary ' ' Madonna of the Rose Garden ' ' by Michelino da Besozzo or Stefano da Verona , also in the museum of Castelvecchio. # Sources # *
