26905514 Nefertkau I was a 4th dynasty princess of ancient Egypt . She was the eldest daughter of King Sneferu and hence a half-sister to King Khufu . She was the mother of Nefermaat II and the grandmother of Sneferukhaf . Nefertkau is explicitly said to be a daughter of Sneferu in inscriptions from the tomb of her son and her grandson . Kurt Heinrich Sethe argued from the inscription in Nefermaats tomb that Nefertkau had married her own father and that Nefermaat was Sneferus son . George Andrew Reisner argued against this theory and suggested that Nefertkau may have married Khufu . He does allow for the possibility that Nefertkau married a noble man whose name was lost . Nefertkau may have buried in mastaba G 7050 at Giza . The tomb is not inscribed however so that the ownership is somewhat conjectural . # References #
