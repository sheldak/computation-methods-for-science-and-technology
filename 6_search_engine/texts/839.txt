30959514 ' ' Erica turgida ' ' ( the Showy Heath or Kenilworth Heath ) is a species of erica that was naturally restricted to the city of Cape Town , South Africa , but is now classified as Extinct in the Wild . This small , delicate erica produces thin , willowy stems , covered in velvety hair . It produces masses of bright-pink , cup-shaped flowers . This Erica used to grow naturally in the area that is now beneath the Cape Town suburbs of Rondebosch , Kenilworth and Wynberg . It was therefore an endemic to the critically endangered Cape Flats Sand Fynbos vegetation type . Soon before the last wild population died out at Kenilworth Racecourse Conservation Area , a woman named Elsie Esterhuizen took cuttings to Kirstenbosch gardens and thus saved the species from permanent extinction . Along with its fellow extinct-in-the-wild heath , ' ' Erica verticillata ' ' , it is now being re-introduced to the Kenilworth Racecourse Conservation Area , now that the spread of the invasive alien vegetation there has been controlled .
