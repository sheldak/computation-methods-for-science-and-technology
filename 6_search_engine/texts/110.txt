2632514 ' ' Under the Moon ' ' was an offbeat , late-night 1990s sports show on the United Kingdom 's Channel 4 . The show was originally hosted by Danny Kelly and comedian Tim Clark . The pair lasted for 10 episodes before Tim left to be replaced by another comedian , Tom Binns . Binns was axed from the show after he offered to give Michael Owen one up the arse after he scored an impressive goal in the 1998 World Cup . He was replaced by Lisa Rogers but the show was cancelled later that year . The show consisted of sports guests , live phone calls from viewers , comedy from Binns , music , and reports all connected to sport . Although a sports show , after the main show had ended , Kelly would later act as an in-vision host providing links to the next programme and were thus listed as part of the show . Examples of these were repeats of the now defunct Channel 4 ' ' GamesMaster ' ' which ran between 1992-1998 . Regular guests included Martin Johnson and @ @ @
