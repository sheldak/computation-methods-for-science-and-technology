12188514 The Church of England , like the other autonomous member churches of the Anglican Communion , has its own system of canon law . The principal body of canon law enacted since the Reformation is the ' ' Book of Canons ' ' approved by the Convocations of Canterbury and York in 1604 and 1606 respectively . There are 151 canons in the collection , some of which reaffirm medieval prescriptions , while others depend on Matthew Parker 's ' ' Book of Advertisements ' ' and the Thirty-nine Articles . They were drawn up in Latin by Richard Bancroft , Bishop of London , and only the Latin text is authoritative . They were published in separate Latin and English editions in 1604 . A few , e.g. canon 37 , were amended in the 19th century . A Canon Law Commission was appointed in 1939 to reconsider the matter of canon law in the Church of England : it held eight sessions between 1943 and 1947 and then issued a report which included a full set of new canons which were subsequently considered by Convocation.
