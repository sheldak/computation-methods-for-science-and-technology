26847514 The New-French Latinisation of the Cantonese Language ( Chinese : , French : Systme Nouvelle-France de la Latinisation de la Langue Cantonaise ) is a romanisation system for Cantonese developed by the New-French Linguistic Society , a group of Cantonese students from Simon Fraser University , Canada . The students ' purposes were corresponding the broad IPA , transcribing different dialects/accents of modern Cantonese , correcting the lazy pronunciations and Cantonese teaching . Thus the system tried to avoid alphabets with different pronunciations in different languages . However , since this system is publicised later than other romanisation systems , and computerised info-processing was sacrificed for accuracy , the system is not yet widely used . # Consonants # # The Rhymes # # The Vowels # # The Endings # Attention : final they have no audible release . # Tones # The New-French Latinisation indicate the tone values directly , which is different from other romanisation systems .
