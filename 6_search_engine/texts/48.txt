1131514 Set partitioning in hierarchical trees ( SPIHT ) is an image compression algorithm that exploits the inherent similarities across the subbands in a wavelet decomposition of an image . # General description # The algorithm codes the most important wavelet transform coefficients first , and transmits the bits so that an increasingly refined copy of the original image can be obtained progressively .
