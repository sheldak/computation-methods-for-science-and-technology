9077514 The Pillan ( of Mapudungun origin ; singular ' ' pilln ' ' and plural ' ' pillanes ' ' in Spanish ) is a powerful and respected male spirit in Mapuche mythology . According to the legend the Pillan are good spirits , but they can also cause disasters , since they also punish ( or they allow the ' ' wekufe ' ' to punish ) with drought or flood , earthquakes , or diseases . The ' ' A <u> nt </u> ' ' is the most powerful Pillan , who governs the others . In the Mapuche tradition , a man that follows the laws of the ' ' admapu ' ' can also become a Pillan after death . The Mapuche perform a ' ' ngillatun ' ' ceremony for the Pillan , for the latter to grant benefits to the people , and to thank them for their gifts . The Pillan have been described as spirits that live in the ' ' Wenumapu ' ' ( a spiritual world of good ) , and those that inhabit the earth generally live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volcano ) . The accompanying female spirits of the Pillan are the Wangulen spirits . The name Pillan was used by Chilean ENAER to name their 2 seat trainer aircraft , the T-35 Pillan
