31922514 Stuffed chine is a traditional dish of salt pork filled with herbs , typically parsley , associated with the English county of Lincolnshire . The neck chine , a cut of a pig taken from between the shoulder blades , is preserved in brine . The meat is then deeply scored and lots of chopped parsley ( other ingredients are normally kept secret ) is stuffed into the cuts and the dish is simmered slowly . It is served sliced cold , when it presents attractively contrasting stripes of pink and green . Food writer Jane Grigson gave a recipe in ' ' The Observer ' ' in March 1984 . The poet Paul Verlaine , who in the mid-1870s spent a year as a schoolmaster just north of Boston , liked stuffed chine so much that he tried unsuccessfully to find it elsewhere in England .
