9250514 Menouthis was a sacred city in ancient Egypt , devoted to the Egyptian goddess Isis and god Serapis . The city was submerged under water in the 8th century as a result of earthquakes or a Nile flood . For a long time , its exact location remained uncertain . Nevertheless , in 2000 , the archaeological team led by Franck Goddio reported rediscovery of Menouthis underwater a little northeast of Alexandria . Menouthis is also the name of a song by E.S . Posthumus , inspired by the ancient city .
