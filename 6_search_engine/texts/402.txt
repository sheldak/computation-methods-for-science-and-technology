12739514 CASNo=10103-60-3 Sodium arsenate is the inorganic compound with the formula NaH <sub> 2 </sub> AsO <sub> 4 </sub> <sup> . </sup> H <sub> 2 </sub> O. Related salts are also called sodium arsenate , including Na <sub> 2 </sub> HAsO <sub> 4 </sub> and Na <sub> 3 </sub> AsO <sub> 4 </sub> . This particular salt is a colorless solid that is highly toxic . The potassium salt has similar properties . The salt is the conjugate base of arsenic acid : : H <sub> 3 </sub> AsO <sub> 4 </sub> H <sub> 2 </sub> AsO + H <sup> + </sup> ( K <sub> 1 </sub> = 10 <sup> 2.19 </sup> ) It is prepared in this way and crystallized by cooling a hot saturated aqueous solution , where it is highly soluble when hot ( 75.3 g in 100 mL at 100 C ) . A fine white powder of the monohydrate crystallizes . Upon heating , the solid loses water of crystallization and then the dihydrogenarsenate anions condense to give Na <sub> 2 </sub> H <sub> 2 </sub> As <sub> 2 </sub> O <sub> 7 </sub> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
