34969514 The terms macrophage and microphage are used in ecology to describe heterotrophs that consume food in two different ways . Both macrophages and microphages ingest solid food and may process it through some sort of alimentary canal . However , a macrophage handles food items singly , while a microphage handles food items in bulk without manipulating them individually . Microphages include suspension feeders , and often incidentally digest low-quality food items . Another category of heterotrophs based on feeding mechanism , known as osmotrophs , is made up of organisms ( primarily fungi and bacteria ) that absorb organism matter directly across their cell membranes . The terms macrophage and microphage were originally used in this sense by Jordan and Hirsch ( 1927 ; cited in Yonge 1928 ) . Although they have been used in ecology texts as recently as 2002 , the terms macrophage and microphage today are primarily used to describe two different types of white blood cells in the vertebrate immune system .
