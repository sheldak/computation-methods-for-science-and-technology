4298514 Kawaimina is a syllabic abbreviation used to refer to four languages and dialects of East Timor : : Kairui , Midiki , Waimaha , and Naueti , spoken by one or two thousand speakers each . It is a name used by linguists discussing the languages , not the speakers themselves . The first three , which may be co-dialects , are spoken in adjacent areas in the western part of Baucau District , along the north coast . Naueti is used on the south coast of eastern Viqueque District , surrounded by speakers of Makasae and Makalero . Some Midiki speakers near Ossu refer to their language as Osomoko . Except perhaps for Naueti , the Kawaimina languages are members of the TimorBabar family of Austronesian languages . While structurally the languages are Malayo-Polynesian , their vocabulary , particularly that of Naueti , derives mostly from Papuan languages . In this they are similar to Makasae and Habun ; none of these languages are easy to classify as either Austronesian or Papuan . The languages are noted for both archaisms and unusual innovations , including vowel harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
