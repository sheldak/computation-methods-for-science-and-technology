5047514 Polo-Cockta ( sometimes written as ' Polo Cockta ' or ' Polo-Cocta ' ) is a Polish Coca-Cola-like drink introduced in the 1970s . Polo-Cockta was introduced as a substitute for the original Coca-Cola , which was unavailable in Polish shops due to limited import from the USA to the Eastern European countries . At first it was based on Cockta , very popular drink from Slovenia ( then Yugoslavia ) . Polo-Cockta was discontinued during the 1980s , but has been revived again for a few years by a private company Zbyszko which acquired all the rights to the brand , reacting to the ever-popular demand for PRL-stylised products . The taste of Polo-Cockta is sometimes described as a mixture of Coca-Cola and Pepsi . Currently available is Polo Cola which replaced the regular Polo-Cockta - however this is actually the same drink with the name changed . Polo-Cockta has made a significant appearance in the Polish film Kingsajz by Juliusz Machulski , where it was a major plot device .
