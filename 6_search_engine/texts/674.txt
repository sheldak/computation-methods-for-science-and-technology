23824514 Gibran is a crater on Mercury , which was discovered in January 2008 during the first flyby of the planet by MESSENGER spacecraft . It contains a large ( ) , nearly circular pit crater . Multiple examples of pit craters have been observed on Mercury on the floors of impact craters , leading to the name pit-floor craters for the impact structures that host these features . Unlike impact craters , pit craters are rimless , often irregularly shaped , steep-sided , and often display no associated ejecta or lava flows . These pit craters are thought to be evidence of shallow volcanic activity and may have formed when retreating magma caused an unsupported area of the surface to collapse , creating a pit . They are analogs of Earth 's volcanic calderas . Pit-floor craters may provide an indication of internal igneous processes where other evidence of volcanic processes is absent or ambiguous . The discovery of multiple pit-floor craters augments evidence that volcanic activity has been a widespread process in the geologic evolution of Mercury 's crust .
