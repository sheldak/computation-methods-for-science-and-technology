8817514 Alma Park is a farming area closely associated with the Pleasant Hills township situated about 17 kilometres to its north . It is a part of the Lockhart Shire Local Government Area . While it is listed in some maps and other documents as a town , it in fact is nothing more than an area of settlement that in some cases is referred to jointly with Pleasant Hills - for example the Alma Park/Pleasant Hills Landcare Group Other than private properties that farm both wheat and similar grain crops and cattle , the only obvious indication of the location of Alma Park is an old Lutheran church that still exists on the Alma Park - Pleasant Hills Road . # German Settlement # Alma Park has close links with the Pleasant Hills community particularly with regard to its Wendish German ( Lutheran ) heritage when a large group of these settlers arrived in the 1880s . At the time Alma Park was referred to as Wallendool . Greendale Post Office opened on 1 July 1875 , was renamed Alma Park in 1905 and closed in 1910 . @ @ @ @ @ @
