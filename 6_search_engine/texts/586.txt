20641514 ' ' Boschniakia hookeri ' ' is a species of parasitic plant in the broomrape family known by the common names Vancouver groundcone and small groundcone . It is native to western North America from British Columbia to northern California , where it grows in wooded areas . It is a parasite of salal bushes , which it parasitizes by penetrating them with haustoria to tap nutrients . The groundcone is visible aboveground as a purplish , brown , or yellowish cone-shaped inflorescence 3 to 6 centimeters long . Pale-colored flowers emerge from between the overlapping bracts . Coastal aboriginal groups ate the potato-like stembase of Ground Cones raw , though usually as a snack and not in any quantity .
