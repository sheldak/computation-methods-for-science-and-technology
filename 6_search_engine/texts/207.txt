5472514 ' ' Chlamydia muridarum ' ' is an intracellular bacterial species that at one time belonged to ' ' Chlamydia trachomatis ' ' . However , ' ' C. trachomatis ' ' naturally only infects humans and ' ' C. muridarum ' ' naturally infects only members of the family Muridae ( includes both mice and hamsters , Alderton , 1996 ) . Two strains of ' ' Chlamydia muridarum ' ' , MoPn ( originally named Nigg ) and SFPD , have been isolated from mice and hamsters . Glycogen production by both strains has been demonstrated . The chromosome and extrachromosomal plasmid of MoPn have been sequenced . ' ' Chlamydia muridarum ' ' MoPn binds mAbs recognizing ' ' Chlamydia trachomatis ' ' MOMP vs4 core epitope ( T ) LNPT(IA) . DNA sequence analysis indicates that these mAbs should recognize SFPD and that ' ' Chlamydia trachomatis ' ' B-serogroup mAbs specific for the vs4 epitope IAGAG should recognize SFPD . MoPn was isolated in 1942 from the lungs of asymptomatic albino Swiss mice and was subsequently shown to be capable of producing disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrent with a causative agent of proliferative ileitis . MoPn has been shown to be sensitive to sulfadiazine. # References #
