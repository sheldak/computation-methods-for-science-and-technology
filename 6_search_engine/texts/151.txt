4032514 Abdul Khaliq Gajadwani ( died 1179 ) was one of a group of Central Asian Sufi teachers known simply as Khwajagan ( the Masters ) of the Naqshbandi order . Abdul Khaliq was born in the small town of Ghijduvan , near Bukhara . His father had migrated to Central Asia from Malatya , in eastern Anatolia where he had been a prominent faqih . While Abdul Khaliq was studying tafsir in Bukhara he first had an awakening of interest in the path . He received further training at the hands of Yusuf Hamdani , and was the next link in the Naqshbandi silsila following him . Abdul Khaliq bequeathed to subsequent generations of the Naqshbandi silsila a series of principles governing their Sufi practice , concisely formulated in Persian and known collectively as the Sacred Words ( ' ' kalimat-i qudsiya ' ' ) , or the Rules or Secrets of the Naqshbandi Order .
