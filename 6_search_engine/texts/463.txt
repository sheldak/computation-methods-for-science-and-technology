It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia . # History # It was first mentioned in 1550 , with a strong indication that it was much older . Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen , formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty . In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia , which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy . After 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans . It was taken from them ( as one from around fifty buildings in the region ) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 15 April 1654 . Tadeusz Kope , Polish politician , was born here . # References #
