19575514 The Old Clay County Courthouse in Clay , West Virginia was designed by Frank L. Packard and built in 1902 . The Beaux-Arts building was located on a hill overlooking the county seat . The courthouse was the site of three notable trials : the Sarah Ann Legg trial of 1905 , the first trial of a woman in Clay County for murder , the Booger Hole trial of 1917 , in which citizens nearly lynched the defendants , and the Oscar Bail trial of 1953 , in which Bail was convicted of killing a mine guard in the Great Widen Coal Strike . Since a new courthouse opened across the street , the old courthouse houses magistrate 's offices and the county extension agent .
