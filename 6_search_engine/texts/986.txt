37429514 In mathematics , the Demazure conjecture is a conjecture about representations of algebraic groups over the integers made by . The conjecture implies that many of the results of his paper can be extended from complex algebraic groups to algebraic groups over fields of other characteristics or over the integers . year=1979 journal=American Mathematical Society . Bulletin . New Series issn=0002-9904 volume=1 issue=2 pages=432435 showed that Demazure 's conjecture ( for classical groups ) follows from their work on standard monomial theory , and Peter Littelmann extended this to all reductive algebraic groups .
