30413514 The Silesian Eagle ( German language : ' ' Schlesischer Adler ' ' ) was a medal awarded for fighting the Silesian Uprisings as part of the Freikorps Oberland under the Weimar Republic . Instituted on the 19 of June 1919 by VI . Armee-Korps Generalleutnant Friedrich von Friedeburg , the Silesian Eagle declined itself in two classes , 2nd class for three months of service and 1st class for 6 months of service and could be adorned with oak leaves , swords , or both . This medal was one of the few Freikorps awards that were allowed to be worn on uniforms during the Third Reich after the 1935 ban on unofficial medals . However , the swords , and oak leaves , denoting additional bravery , merit or service were banned , but despite interdictions , many veterans continued wearing them in active military service with the Third Reich .
