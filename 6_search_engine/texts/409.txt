12990514 The Brigantine Lighthouse is a lighthouse in Brigantine , New Jersey , USA . It was built in 1926 by the Island Development Real Estate Company to attract people to Brigantine Beach Island and not as an operating lighthouse . Over the years , it has served as the headquarters for the Brigantine Police Department , as a museum and a gift shop . The lighthouse fell into disrepair in the early 1990s , so a group of volunteers refurbished the building in 1995 . Today , the Brigantine Lighthouse is one of Brigantine 's most noticeable features .
