This bill has been seen by many as an attempt to single out evolution in classrooms . This law would also require them to teach beliefs that may contradict their own personal views . Conversely , the lack of this law may allow professors to retaliate via grading against students who do not hold the same political views . An academic Bill of Rights is law in Florida .
