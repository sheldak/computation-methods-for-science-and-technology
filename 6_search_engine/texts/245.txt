6826514 Wark on Tweed ( usually referred to simply as Wark ) is a village in the English county of Northumberland . It lies about south west of Berwick-upon-Tweed It is on the south bank of the River Tweed that can be considered the border between England and Scotland . # Landmarks # The ruins of Wark on Tweed castle , originally an early 12th century motte-and-bailey , lie at the west end of the village . The castle ( alternatively referred to as Carham Castle ) was strategically important in the wars between Scotland and England , as the border cuts south from the Tweed not far upstream . The view of Wark for the Scottish and English was therefore uncomfortably or conveniently , respectively , close to Roxburgh , and a good base for English advances into Tweedale . It was demolished and rebuilt on several occasions between the 12th and 16th centuries . It is one of a number of supposed locations for the garter incident behind the naming of the Order of the Garter. # Notable people # *Robert Story ( poet )
