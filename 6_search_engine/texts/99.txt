2387514 A redeco ( from redecorate ) is a re-released version of an existing toy with a color scheme that is significantly different from the original release . Redecos normally include changes to the toy 's paint application scheme , as opposed to a more straightforward repaint , which only alters the colors , not the ways in which they are applied to the toy . Redecos are an extremely popular way to create exclusive toys , allowing the new toy to look drastically different from the original , sometimes representing a different character , entity or item , without having to pay for an entirely new mold . Examples : * In ' ' Transformers ' ' with Autobots , the toys of Starscream are often redecoed into Thundercracker and/or Skywarp . Similarly , toys of Optimus Prime are sometimes redecoed into Ultra Magnus or Nemesis Prime , and Megatron may be redecoed into Galvatron. * Mighty Muggs all share essentially the same mold , with identity and characterization entirely provided ' ' only ' ' by the deco of each redeco. # References #
