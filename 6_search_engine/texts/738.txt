25900514 ' ' Williella ' ' is a genus of moths belonging to the subfamily Tortricinae of the family Tortricidae. # Details # The moth genus ' ' Williella ' ' , family Tortricidae , subfamily Tortricinae , was established in 1984 to accommodate two newly-described species from New Caledonia : ' ' Williella sauteri ' ' and ' ' Williella angulata ' ' . ' ' Williella ' ' was tentatively assigned to the base of the Archipini . Phylogenetic analysis of their plesiomorphic morphology suggested that ' ' Williella ' ' species are members of a group of isolated and generalized moths from Australia , New Zealand and South America . The discovery of the genus in New Caledonia suggested that these plesiomorphic modern Tortricinae are isolated descendants of a group of very generalized Tortricinae that were distributed throughout the Gondwana supercontinent before it broke up into many of the main modern landmasses of the Southern Hemisphere . # Species # * ' ' Williella angulata ' ' <small> Horak , 1984 </small> * ' ' Williella picdupina ' ' <small> Razowski , 2013 </small> * ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
