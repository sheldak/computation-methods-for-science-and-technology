33848514 In Riemannian geometry , a field of mathematics , Preissman 's theorem is a statement that restricts the possible topology of a negatively curved compact Riemannian manifold ' ' M ' ' . Specifically , the theorem states that every non-trivial abelian subgroup of the fundamental group of ' ' M ' ' must be isomorphic to the additive group of integers , Z . <ref> citation For instance , a compact surface of genus two admits a Riemannian metric of curvature equal to &amp;minus ; 1 ( see the uniformization theorem ) . The fundamental group of such a surface is isomorphic to the free group on two letters . Indeed , the only abelian subgroups of this group are isomorphic to Z . A corollary of Preissman 's theorem is that the ' ' n ' ' -dimensional torus , where ' ' n ' ' is at least two , admits no Riemannian metric of negative sectional curvature .
