3770514 James Hugh Sinclair ( 16 October 1876 , in Swellendam , Cape Province 23 February 1913 , in Yeoville , Gauteng ) was a South African cricketer who played in 25 Tests from 1896 to 1911 . He also played international rugby union and won a single international appearance in association football . This feat of having made international appearances in three distinct sports is , as far as this editor is aware , shared by only two other South Africans , one of whom was Percy Sherwell ( cricket , association football and tennis ) . It is on record that he hit the first test century by a South African , and several of the records which he established were only surpassed during the 1990s and later . A 2006 source shows Sinclair as still being the world 's 6th quickest batsman . There are also various stories told about Sinclair , including that relating the occasion on which a ball which he had hit for a six at the old Wanderers ' Ground in Johannesburg ( Central ) landed on a train bound for Port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball was for many years on display at the Wanderers ' clubhouse ( both old and new grounds ) until a fire in the latter part of the 20th century .
