6789514 Comprehensive high schools are the most popular form of public high schools in the United States which serve the needs of all students , as compared to the common practice in other nations in which examinations are used to sort students into different high schools for different populations . Some high schools specialize in University-preparatory school academic preparation , some in remedial instruction , and some in vocational instruction . The average comprehensive high school offers more than one course of specialization in its program . Comprehensive high schools generally offer a college preparatory course and one or more scientific or vocational courses . Numerous school districts in the United States also have schools tailored to high-performing students and other students who do not succeed best in a comprehensive environment . However , these schools may also have varying numbers of high-performing student classes . This can lead to unpreparedness in post-secondary education . # See also # * High school * Continuation high school * Alternative high school * Comprehensive school - the equivalent in the UK and elsewhere # References # *
