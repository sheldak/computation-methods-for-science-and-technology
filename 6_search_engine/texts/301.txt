8600514 Chaubunagungamaug Reservation in Webster , Massachusetts , was established in the 1680s for the group of Nipmuc Indians now known as the Webster/Dudley Band of Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuck . For two centuries ( the 1680s until the 1890s ) , this reservation supported a community of Nipmuck . From the 1890s until the mid-1970s the Nipmuck presence on this land consisted of the Morse family and their immediate relatives . From 1978 through the mid-1990s , the Chaubunagungamaug Band , as an organization , appears to have consisted , essentially , only of the extended Morse family . Together with the Hassanamisco Nipmuc of Grafton , Massachusetts and other families and individuals who identified as Nipmuc Indian , this group received recognition from the Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs in 1979 . Although the Nipmuck are recognized by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , in 2004 the Bureau of Indian Affairs decided that the Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuc group does not meet four of the seven mandatory requirements for U.S. Federal Government acknowledgment as a nation .
