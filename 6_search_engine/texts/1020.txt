It is directly behind the prostomium and contains the mouth , tentacular cirri , and sometimes feeding palps , which may instead occur on the prostomium . If an eversible pharynx is present , it is contained in this segment as well , and can fill up to 20 segments when inverted , depending on the species . The prostomium and peristomium can be variously fused , either completely distinct , or comprising a joint structure of a peristomial ring and a tentacular crown .
