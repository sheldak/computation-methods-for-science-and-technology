It lies to the southwest of the crater Cavendish and south of Mersenius . The rim of de Gasparis is worn and eroded , and the interior has been flooded by basaltic lava . The surviving outer rim reaches a maximum altitude of about 0.8 km . This crater is notable for the formation of rilles that criss-cross the floor and the surrounding surface . This system of clefts in the surface is designated Rimae de Gasparis , and they span an area of about 130 kilometers in diameter . The rilles are thought to have been created due to tectonic faults deep below the surface . As they cut across de Gasparis , this indicates that they were formed after the crater. # Satellite craters # By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest @ @ @
