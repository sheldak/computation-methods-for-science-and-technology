1211514 Spectral induced polarisation ( SIP ) or Complex resistivity is a geophysical survey technique and an extension of the induced polarisation ( IP ) method , being itself an extension of measuring the Earth 's resistance at a single frequency or under direct current ( a technique commonly known by the name resistivity ) . SIP measures the frequency-dependent ( i.e. spectral ) complex impedance , equivalent to the amount of resistance and phase shift between electrical current and voltage . The usual frequency range for alternating current ( AC ) applied during SIP surveys is tens of kHz to mHz . As with other geophysical methods , SIP aims to distinguish material properties of the subsurface , such as salinity and saturation .
