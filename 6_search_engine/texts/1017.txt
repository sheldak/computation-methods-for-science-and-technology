38858514 A coin watch comprises a watch inserted into a coin or medal . A coin watch is typically made by slicing a coin into two disks , one thinner than the other ; or by removing one face of a coin . A watch is then embedded into the thicker part , and the two faces joined by a concealed hinge and catch . When closed , the watch is hidden and the coin looks like any other . Noted makers of coin watches include Cartier and Corum. # References #
