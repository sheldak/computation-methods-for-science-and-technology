2181514 ' ' Thumb Bandits ' ' was a British video game television series . It aired on Channel 4 in 2001 . The programme was presented by Iain Lee and Aleks Krotoski , but only had 2 series and ran for thirteen episodes . The show featured location film items , studio based reviews and news . In earlier episodes Lee 's role was meant to be a somewhat synical foil to Krotoski 's enthusiastic style . The series was hamped by a very late time slot on C4 but did get reasonable viewing figures of around 900,000 a night , not bad for the time . Studio excerpts were shot in an abandoned hospital made TV studio in Glasgow . It was produced by Steve Keen , who also made 3 series of Bad Influence , ITVs Cybernet , Movies Games and Videos and various other video games shows of the era . Of note was the episode that included an interview by Lee of Chris No 3 from rock band Slipknot who were on tour at the time . The band were notoriously hard to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only TVTV appearances .
