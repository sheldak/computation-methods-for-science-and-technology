26345514 The Kansas Supreme Court has ruled that the necessity defense may not be used when the harm the defendant claims to be avoiding through his actions was legal , while the action undertaken to prevent it was illegal . This question became an issue in the 2010 trial of Scott Roeder for the assassination of notorious late-term abortion provider George Tiller . Judge Warren Wilbert refused to allow the defense to present a plea of necessity , but did allow them to present a case for voluntary manslaughter on the grounds that the defendant sincerely believed that he was committing a crime to prevent a greater evil .
