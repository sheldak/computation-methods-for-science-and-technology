In enzymology , a **25;6469;TOOLONG phosphodiesterase ( ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction : dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate + H <sub> 2 </sub> O <math> rightleftharpoons </math> dolichyl phosphate + D-glucose Thus , the two substrates of this enzyme are dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate and H <sub> 2 </sub> O , whereas its two products are dolichyl phosphate and D-glucose . This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds . The systematic name of this enzyme class is **34;6496;TOOLONG dolichylphosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include dolichol phosphoglucose phosphodiesterase , and Dol-P-Glc phosphodiesterase . This enzyme participates in n-glycan biosynthesis.
