Mou Waho Island is an island in Lake Wanaka , New Zealand . It is around the same size as the nearby Mou Tapu Island , these two islands being the largest in the lake . Buff Weka can be found on the island but will predate the many native wildlife which include mountain stone wetas , cave wetas , and Southern Alps gecko . For this reason students of the local Mount Aspiring College built 40 small wooden ' ' motels ' ' for these animals to safely live in.
