Mississippi State Axion Search is the first of its kind light shining through the wall experiment designed to operate using a continuous radio wave emitter as the source of photons . The experiment contains a radio source and a set of detectors separated by a wall . The aim of the experiment is to limit the mass and coupling constants of an axion like particle or a para photon by looking at the photons on the dark side of the tuned cavity . The experiment is projected to be completed by 2016. # Overview # # Physics Motivation # # Collaboration # The collaboration currently includes members from the following institutions ; * Mississippi State University # References #
