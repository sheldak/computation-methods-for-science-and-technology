The rosid family Putranjivaceae is composed of about 210 species of evergreen tropical trees distributed into 4 genera . Members of this family have 2-ranked coriaceous leaves , which , if fresh , typically have a radish-like or peppery taste . The flowers are fasciculate and usually small , and the fruits of these species are a single-seeded drupe crown by the persistent stigmas . This family has its origin in Africa and Malesia. # Taxonomy # This family was formerly a tribe ( Drypeteae ) of the subfamily Phyllanthoideae in the Euphorbiaceae . When the Phyllanthoideae was separated to form the new family Phyllanthaceae , it was decided that Drypeteae also stand alone . # References # http : **59;9984;TOOLONG , Encyclopdia Britannica Online
