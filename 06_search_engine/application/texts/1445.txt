A railway section house is a building or house-like structure located near or next to a section of railroad used for housing railroad workers , or for the storing and maintenance of equipment for a section of railroad . Section houses were used mainly from the 1890s to the 1960s . By the 1970s , section houses were being slowly phased out . In Canada section houses were usually located right across from the railway station . # Examples # * Kansas Pacific Railway Section House , an 1879 stone railroad superintendent 's residence , one of only two remaining Kansas Pacific Railroad structures .
