The Hortobgyi palacsinta is a savoury Hungarian pancake , filled with meat ( usually veal ) . The meat is prepared as a stew ; minced meat is fried with onions and spices like the prklt or the papriks dish , using , veal , veal with mushrooms , chicken or Hungarian sausage . The pancakes are filled with the minced meat , tucking in the ends , and are baked in the oven with a pepper and sour cream , then topped with fresh parsley . The dish actually does not originate from the Hortobgy National Park region of the Great Hungarian Plain and has nothing to do with Hortobgy . It was originally invented for the 1958 Brussels World Fair . However some Hungarian recipe books already featured a similar recipe in the 1930s . The name of the food is simply a marketing trick .
