The Huanren frog , ' ' Rana huanrensis ' ' , is a species of true frog found in East Asia . It was originally believed to be endemic to Huanren County , Liaoning , China , but was later also found in South Korea ; it is presumed to be present in North Korea , as well . It is closely related to the Dybowski 's frog , ' ' Rana dybowskii ' ' , and specimens collected before 1991 were incorrectly identified as that species . Distinguishing factors include the absence of a vocal sac . The Huanren frog is found in and around rivers and streams in hilly terrain . The type locality in Huanren is 520m ft above sea level , and specimens from Korea have also only been found at altitudes over 500m ft . Specimens from South Korea have been collected in the provinces of Gangwon-do , Gyeongsangbuk-do , and eastern Gyeonggi-do . Egg clutches , which are small and clustered , are deposited on submerged rocks in the streams which this species favors.
