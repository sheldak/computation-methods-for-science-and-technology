The 1859 British general election in Ireland produced one of the last overall victories for the Tories in Ireland . Their win , however , did not mean that Ireland was supporting the Tories , though the party did have some strong pockets of support on the island . The win was a result of a restricted electoral franchise which saw voting restricted to the middle and upper classes , who were disproportionately supportive of the Tory Party in Ireland . Electoral reform in subsequent decades saw a sharp decline in Tory fortunes in Ireland , with new voters , who had not been Tory supporters anyhow , supporting first of all the Liberal Party , notably in the 1868 general election in Ireland and later the Irish Parliamentary Party from the 1874 general election in Ireland onwards . # Results #
