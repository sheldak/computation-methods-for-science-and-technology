' ' Formica sanguinea ' ' is a species of slave-maker ant . It ranges from Central and Northern Europe through Russia to Japan , China , the Korean Peninsula , and also the United States . This species is colored red and black with workers up to 7 mm long . Its common name comes from their practice of enslaving other species of ants . A colony of ' ' F. sanguinea ' ' can live either by itself or as a social parasite on certain other ' ' Formica ' ' species . In the latter case , a fertilized ' ' F. sanguinea ' ' queen will enter the nest of the host ant species and kill their queen . She then takes advantage of the workers who tend to her and her brood . ' ' F. sanguinea ' ' workers will also raid nearby nests , stealing larvae and pupae to become future workers for ' ' F. sanguinea ' ' .
