Pincevent is an archaeological site in the commune of La Grande-Paroisse in France , near the town of Montereau-Fault-Yonne ( Seine-et-Marne ) . It was excavated from 1964 onward by a team of the Centre des Recherches Prhistoriques of the University of Paris , led by Andr Leroi-Gourhan . Although there is evidence that the area was visited throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene , the site has become known for its Magdalenian remains , preserved in clays and silts deposited by the river Seine . These remains consist of stone artifacts and bone fragments , as well as numerous hearths , and are considered to point to repeated occupation by reindeer hunters .
