: ' ' This article is about the Greek artist . For Eirene , the personification of peace and wealth , one of the Horae , see Horae ' ' . Eirene or Irene was an ancient Greek artist described by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century . She was the daughter of a painter , and created an image of a girl that was housed at Eleusis . During the Renaissance , Boccaccio , a 14th-century humanist , included Eirene in ' ' De mulieribus claris ' ' ( Latin for ' ' On Famous Women ' ' ) . However , in this telling Boccaccio apparently conflated many of the women described by Pliny and attributed many more works to Eirene . Some other paintings he credits to Eirene are an older Calypso , the gladiator Theodorus , and a famous dancer called Alcisthenes.
