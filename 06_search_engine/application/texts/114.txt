Henry Bech is a fictional character created by American author John Updike . Bech first appeared in assorted short stories , stories which were later compiled in the books ' ' Bech : A Book ' ' ( 1970 ) , ' ' Bech Is Back ' ' ( 1982 ) , and ' ' Bech at Bay ' ' ( 1998 ) . These books were all later collected in ' ' The Complete Henry Bech ' ' ( 2001 ) , which also included the short story ' ' His Oeuvre ' ' ( 2000 ) . Updike 's Bech is considered an antihero , and Updike 's alter-ego . While Updike generally concerns himself with WASP culture , is married , and is famously prolific , Bech is apathetically Jewish , a bachelor ( later a husband and stepfather for a time , and finally a father in old age ) , and famously unprolific . In the introduction to his first collection , the eponymous author speculates he is modeled in part after many other famous writers , including Norman Mailer , Bernard Malamud .
