l-Hesn d-Dakhl ( Standard Arabic : al-Hassan ad-Dkhil The One who Entered ) was a direct ancestor to Moulay Ali Cherif , founder of the Alaouite Dynasty , which is the current Moroccan royal family . He was taken to Morocco from the town of Yanbu in the Hejaz at the end of the 13th century by the inhabitants of Tafilalt to be their Imm . They were hoping that , as he was a descendant of the prophet Muhammad , his presence would help to improve their date palm crops thanks to his ' ' barakah ' ' ( an Islamic term meaning a sense of divine presence or charisma ) .
