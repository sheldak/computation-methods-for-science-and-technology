The Binary Format Description ( BFD ) language is an extension of XSIL which has added conditionals and the ability to reference files by their stream numbers , rather than by their public URLs . A template written in the BFD language can be applied to a binary data file to produce a file with that data formatted with descriptive XML tags . Such XML-tagged data is then readable by humans and generally by a wider set of computer programs than could read the original data file .
