A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing , usually a crankshaft main bearing of a piston engine . Most bearing caps are retained by two bolts , one on each side of the bearing journal , and parallel to the cylinder axis . A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts , at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes . These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other , or else two blind bolts threaded into the bearing cap from each side . Cross-bolting has two advantages : it couples the two sides of the crankcase together , making it stiffer overall and less prone to twisting . Secondly it helps to hold the bearing cap down against the downward force from the piston . This second advantage is usually only possible with blind bolts , as the dowel effect of a through bolt is less effective .
