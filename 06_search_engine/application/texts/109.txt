Tipperary is the name of an Irish-oriented love song written in 1907 by Leo Curley , James M. Fulton and J. Fred Helf . It is not to be confused with the much better-known song from 1912 , It 's a Long Way to Tipperary . Both were sung at different times by early recording star Billy Murray . The full lyrics can be found at and . Chorus : Faith , it 's me that 's nearly crazy : From me Tipperary daisy : All the day me heart 's un-aisy uneasy : Sure , the thing I find : That 's on me mind : Is the darlin ' girl I left behind : Far off in dear old Tipperary . The term ferninst which appears in the second verse is an old-fashioned expression meaning beside ( as in she sat ferninst me ) .
