Pyrognomic materials are easily made incandescent . Minerals and metals commonly glow when heated , but those that are pyrognomic glow at much lower temperatures . Allanite and gadolinite are examples of pyrognomic minerals . The term was introduced by the German chemist and mineralogist Theodor Scheerer ( 1813-1873 ) in 1840 , but the phenomenon had been previously observed by William Hyde Wollaston and Jns Jacob Berzelius.
