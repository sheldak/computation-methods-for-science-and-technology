The Brown Parrotbill ( ' ' Cholornis unicolor ' ' ) is a parrotbill found in the central and eastern Himalayas . It has earlier been called a Brown Suthora . This is a 17-19 cm long grey brown bird with a long tail and a characteristic small yellowish parrot-like bill . A dark stripe runs above the eyes and along the sides of the crown . They move in small groups and will sometimes join mixed species foraging flocks . It is found in Bhutan , China , India , Myanmar , and Nepal . Originally described by Brian Houghton Hodgson in the genus ' ' Hemirhynchus ' ' this species was later included in the genus ' ' Heteromorpha ' ' . They are now usually treated as members of the family Paradoxornithidae within which its closes relative is the Three-toed Parrotbill . Subspecies ' ' canaster ' ' described by Thayer and Bangs in 1912 from Hsikang and ' ' saturatior ' ' described by Rothschild in 1921 froom Yunnan are generally not considered valid .
