Bigoli ( Venetian : ' ' bgoi ' ' ) is an extruded pasta in the form of a long and thick tube . Traditionally they were made with buckwheat flour , but are more commonly made with whole wheat flour now . Traditionally , duck eggs are used for the pasta . It closely resembles bucatini . Bigoli is a term used in Treviso , whereas the term pici is used in Tuscany for a similar sized pasta without the hole in the center . In La vecchia cucina eugubina they say that this noodle is as thick as a wooden needle for knitting stockings .
