Cacamatzin ( or Cacama ) ( 14831520 ) was the king of Texcoco , the second most important city of the Aztec Empire . Cacamatzin was a son of the previous king Nezahualpilli by one of his mistresses . Traditionally , the Texcocan kings were elected by the nobility from the most able of the royal family . Cacamatzin 's election to the throne in 1515 was said to have been made under considerable pressure from Moctezuma II , lord of Tenochtitln . Moctezuma II wished to lessen Texcoco 's power in favor of greater centralization in Tenochtitln . Cacamatzin was strangled by soldiers of Spanish conquistador Hernn Corts , who some sources say were torturing him in an effort to get gold .
