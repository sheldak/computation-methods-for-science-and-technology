The Authorized Steinway Virtual Concert Grand Piano from the company Garritan , is a sample-based software instrument developed in collaboration with the piano manufacturer Steinway &amp; Sons . The Authorized Steinway Virtual Concert Grand Piano recreates the sound of the Steinway concert grand piano model D-274 . The software comes in two versions : Professional and Basic . The Professional version is the Steinway concert grand piano from five different listening perspectives : that of the player from the piano bench ; a classical recording ; an under-the-lid ; a stage ; and a close audience perspective . The Basic version is , according to Garritan , ideal for students , amateur musicians , and educators , and is a light version that gives a single perspective .
