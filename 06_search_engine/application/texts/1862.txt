Michel Las Vergnas ( January 11 , 1941 January 19 , 2013 ) was a French mathematician associated with Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University in Paris , and a research director emeritus at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique . Las Vergnas earned his Ph.D . in 1972 from Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University , under the supervision of Claude Berge . He was one of the founders of the ' ' European Journal of Combinatorics ' ' , which began publishing in 1980 . His initial research was in graph theory , and particularly in the theories of matching and connectivity . Beginning in 1975 , he became one of the pioneers of the theory of oriented matroids , and since that time he was interested in connections between combinatorics and geometry . A workshop on combinatorial geometry , held in Marseilles in April 2013 , was dedicated to his memory .
