The Via Sacra ( Latin for ' ' Holy Road ' ' ) is a centuries old pilgrimage trail in Lower Austria . It starts in Vienna and passes through the Wienerwald to Mariazell . The trail goes from Mdling through Gaaden , Heiligenkreuz , Alland , and the pilgrimage destination Hafnerberg , first into the Triestingtal , and then over the Gerichtsberg into the Glsental and Traisental . Along it there are many remarkable shrines . The pilgrims have been an economic factor in the area since early in its history . There are many inns on the trail , which live off the pilgrims . Today , the region also seeks to profit from the road . As a result , annual concert cycles are held at the Heiligenkreuz monastery .
