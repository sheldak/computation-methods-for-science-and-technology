The Al-Fourqaan mosque is a salafi Islamic mosque in which is part of Al-fourqaan Islamic Center in Eindhoven , Netherlands . The mosque received media attention since 2005 for its jihadist imam ' ' Eisha Bersham ' ' from Bosnia . Intelligence service AIVD classified him as a threat to national security , and minister for integration and immigration Rita Verdonk responded by banning him from the country as an ' unwanted foreigner ' . Initially an Amsterdam court ruled that the imam could stay , but on 27 April 2007 the Council of State finally ruled Bersham would be banned from the Netherlands for the next ten years . Two other men regularly prayed in the Al-Fourqaan mosque ; Ahmed El Bakiouli and Khalid El Hassnoui . They were reportedly recruited by Algerian terrorist group Groupe Salafiste pour la Prdication et le Combat to fight in the holy war . They were both killed in Kashmir ( India ) where Muslims have been fighting a separatist war .
