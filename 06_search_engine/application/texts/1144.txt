A Brown Betty is a type of teapot , round and with a manganese brown glaze known as Rockingham glaze . The original teapots came from a red clay that was discovered in the Stoke-on-Trent area of Britain , in 1695 . This special clay seemed to retain heat better and so found use as the material for the teapot as early as the seventeenth century . These early pots were tall and shaped more like coffee pots . In the nineteenth century the pots began to take on the more rounded shape of the modern Brown Betty . The Rockingham Glaze was brushed on the pot and allowed to run down the sides , creating a streaky finish as it was fired . In the Victorian era , when tea was at its peak of popularity , tea brewed in the Brown Betty was considered excellent . This was attributed to the design of the pot which allowed the tea leaves more freedom to swirl around as the water was poured into the pot , releasing more flavour with less bitterness .
