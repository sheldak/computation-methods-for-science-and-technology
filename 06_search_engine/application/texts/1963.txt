Lungotevere della Farnesina is the stretch of Lungotevere that links Piazza Trilussa to Ponte Giuseppe Mazzini in Rome ( Italy ) , in the Rione Trastevere . The Lungotevere takes its name from villa Farnesina , the present seat of the Accademia dei Lincei . The works for the building of the Lungotevere , in 1879 , brought to light the sepulchre of Gaius Sulpicius Platorinus , dating back to the 1st century ; after being reconstructed , it was moved to the National Roman Museum within the Baths of Diocletian . # Notes # <references/> # Bibliography # *
