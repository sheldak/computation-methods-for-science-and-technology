Highcockalorum or High Cockalorum is a mess game which involves two teams of roughly 12 people played in a large open space , such as a hall . One team , the supporting team , stands in a line at one end of the hall . The other team lines up at the opposite side . The other team must run as fast as they can and jump onto the backs of the supporting team . If all the players remain mounted for 10 seconds , the supporting team gets a point . They then swap over . The game , notorious for its danger , was banned in the 1950s after being popular in the Second World War .
