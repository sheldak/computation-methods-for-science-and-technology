A breaker is a piece of reef against which waves break . This sense of the term is closely related to another sense , that of the breaking wave itself . In times past , when ocean navigation was relatively rudimentary , a line of breaking waves was a crucial indicator that a boat was bearing down upon an island or reef . This was especially the case when sailing in darkness , in which the highly visible line of froth caused by breaking waves could be the only such indicator . In such cases the line of breakers was charted and named as a breaker .
